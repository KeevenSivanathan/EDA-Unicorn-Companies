# EDA-Unicorn-Companies
Performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a dataset about Unicorn companies. 

A Unicorn company is a company that has reached a valuation of $1 billion USD without being listed on the stock market. As of 2022, there are over 1000 unicorn companies. 

My notebook goes over cleaning the data to prepare it for EDA. 

Using EDA to understand:
1. Which industry has produced the most unicorn companies?
2. Which country has the most unicorn companies?
3. How do the number of investors affect valuation of company and money raised by the company?
4. The differences between the a Unicorn, Decacorn and Hectocorn, as I would like to call it corn_status. 
5. How the different corn statuses affect valuation and money raised  
6. How the number of unicorn companies have changed over time.
